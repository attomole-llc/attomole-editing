            <h2>Joseph Yim</h2>
            <p>
              For nearly fifteen years, Joseph Yim has taught writing in hagwons, English camps,
              and private settings—helping students turn ideas into essays that are genuine,
              structured, and impactful. Drawing on his background in sociology from UC Berkeley
              and law from Harvard Law School, he teaches students to think critically about
              audience, diction, tone, and structure—approaching writing as both art and system.
              Having guided more than seventy students through college and graduate applications,
              Joseph encourages honest thinking over fancy words and helps writers express complex
              ideas simply, beautifully, and with purpose.
